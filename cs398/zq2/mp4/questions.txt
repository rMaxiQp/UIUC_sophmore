1: To detect robots, I first pick a window and check post frequency of each user.
   If the user has a large amount of posts, he/she would be the potential target.
   Therefore, I would compare each post by user and check for their similarity.
   If most of the user's posts are similar, this user should be classified as robot.

2: BatchDuration is the length of each batch, while window Length and sideInterval are
   associated with more specific classification of the length of RDD which is part of the
   dStream that is formed with batches.

3: dStream is the continous stream of RDDs

4: Checkpoint is a process to write input stream into HDFS. It is fault tolerant, which improves stream reliability.
   If we need an essentially real stream, this would be essential to be enabled.
