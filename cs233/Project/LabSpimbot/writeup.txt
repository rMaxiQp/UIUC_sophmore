Strategies:
1. Our bot mostly runs on the circle near the jetstream unless the bot is interrupted by the star signal.
   So we can run in a faster than our opponents who do not always run on the jetstream.
2. Our bot can fetch at least four stars and request a puzzle to solve,
   which can be rewarded by a banana or a mushroom to speed us up.
   (We are not gonna to use banana because it might hurt ourselves if the opponents do not have the same running track with ours).
3. Although our bot is not able to avoid the space junk (banana),
  if we eat all the bananas on the first turn of our running trace, we will not no chance to eat bananas after that.
